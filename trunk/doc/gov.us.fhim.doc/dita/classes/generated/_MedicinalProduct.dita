A code given to a device may also be known as "unique device identifier". Unlike a device instance identifier,  however, this is a code for the specific kind of device analogously to the NDC code or UPC code that is a code of a  manufactured kind of product respectively. The words "product code" "unique device identifiers" may have certain specific  connotations in different regulatory contexts, to side-step such unwanted connotations, one may call this code the "Item  Code", for it is the code for the item (product, medicine, thing, or class thereof) that is so described." - HL7 V3</i></lines></p></li></ul></li>

While the data type ED would allow for a full product monograph to be carried in this  attribute, this practice is to be avoided, because product monograph document structures (Structured Product Labeling)  should be used instead for such documents. The description attribute is mainly to be used for brief descriptions which  users of product catalogs can use to quickly distinguish this product from other similar products in a list of products." -  HL7 V3</i></lines></p></li></ul></li>

<ul><li><p><lines><i>&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;      "The principle form of a product, such as dosage form of a medicine. Values may be drawn from the MaterialForm HL7      vocabulary table or from other external code value sources. Notice the difference between an (Administered) Medicine      and a PackagedMedicine. Both have formCodes. A box or vial is usually not a medicine Product.formCode but a      PackageProduct.formCode, unless the entire box or the entire vial is meant for direct administration as a single unit.      In principle, the formCode is a very coarsely-grained (high level) product class that focuses on physical appearance.      At the top, it usually distinguishes between physical state of matter (solid, liquid, gaseous), and, because solids may      be amorphous (e.g., powders), would allow distinguishing solid shaped from amorphous masses. The former can be      individually handled and counted, whereas the latter (amorphous masses) can only be measured and require primary      containers for handling. Thus the formCode has implications for how the product is quantified (counted vs. measured)      and whether a primary container (e.g., vial) may be expected." - HL7 V3  &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;</i></lines></p></li></ul></li>
