<p>A person who is named as a beneficiary of a plan, such as an insurance plan.    Enrollee: 'An eligible individual who is enrolled in a health plan - does not include an eligible dependent.' -eHealthInsurance.org  Subscriber: 'This term has two meanings _ first, it refers to a person or organization who pays the premiums, and second, the person whose employment makes him or her eligible for membership in the plan.' -eHealthInsurance.org    DOD: if the person is active duty, he is automatically enrolled into the 'direct care' program as a subscriber.  If he is a retiree, he is eligible to enroll in several programs such as Tricare for life.  If he does, he's still considered a subscriber.    'sponsor' and 'subscriber' are sometimes used interchangeably.</p>
