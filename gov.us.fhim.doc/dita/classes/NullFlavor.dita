<row><entry>Description</entry><entry>This enumeration defines the set of possible "null-flavors", which are used to communicate why a datatype value is empty  when otherwise it should not be empty.  Null Flavor: "If a value is an exceptional value (NULL-value), this specifies in what way and why proper information is  missing." - HL7 V3
